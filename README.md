# nosql-challenge

For this challenge, I am showcasinng my skills in importing, filtering, and updating data using Pymongo while simultaneously manipulating the data even further using Pandas. All the code provided was of my own, I did get help from my weekly tutor David regarding syntax and ASKBCs for certain questions that confused me.
